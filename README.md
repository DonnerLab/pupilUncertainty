# pupilUncertainty #

This is the overall repository that replicates all analyses from
_Urai AE, Braun A, Donner THD. Decision Uncertainty Drives Pupil-linked Arousal Systems and Modulates Sequential Choice Bias._

### This repository contains ###
- Task_2IFC_RandomDots, containing all the code neede to run the behavioural and eye-tracking task. This code runs under PsychToolbox-3 (http://psychtoolbox.org). The scripts s1a and s1b show instructions and examples to the participant (in Dutch), and s3_2IFC_Main.m runs the main experiment.
The data that were collected are in the Zenodo repository XXX.
- Analysis, containg all Matlab files to replicate the analyses. Going through the files in alphabetical order will get you from data to final figures. The Data folder contains a few sample files to try out the code.
- serial-dependencies, a modification of https://bitbucket.org/mackelab/serial_decision/ that includes a modulatory interaction term in the history model. 


###What to do to replicate our full analyses###

1. Get the data and code
  * download and unzip all the files from FigShare
  * put all the folders P01-P27 inside the Data folder to recreate the folder structure we want to work with
  * put the MotionEnergy folder inside the Data folder
  * get the repository with the code from GitHub and change the name of the folder to Code
  * put both Code and Data in a folder called pupilUncertainty, you'll need the name of this path.

2. Rerun the analyses
  * open a0_reproduceAnalyses.m and follow instructions
