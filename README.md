# pupilUncertainty

Urai AE, Braun A, Donner THD. Eye-opener: pupil dilation signals decision uncertainty.

This repository contains:
*	Task_2IFC_RandomDots, containing all the code neede to run the behavioural and eye-tracking task. This code runs under PsychToolbox-3 (http://psychtoolbox.org). The scripts s1a and s1b show instructions and examples to the participant (in Dutch), and s3_2IFC_Main.m runs the main experiment.
*	Analysis, containing Jupyter notebooks outlining all the steps in the code. Going through the files in alphabetical order will get you from data to final figures. The Data folder contains a few sample files to try out the code.

This code was run under Matlab2015b. Some functionality, for example for reading and writing table files, is not available in earlier releases.
